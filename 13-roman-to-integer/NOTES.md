make a map for all roman no.'s as key and arabic no. as value
then
first just add the last no. corresponding to last elemet  of string if the second last or better to say he element just left tto it is less than the no. then subtaract by the no. at left
eg IV it denotes 4 so first we will add 5 to ans since I<V so will subtract by I then ans would be 4. we will do this we reach the first character of string.
